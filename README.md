# ESR_GAN

* Project on state-of-the-art Super- ResolutionGANusing Python, Tensorflowand PyTorch,
implementing a sophisticated generator composed of Residual in Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB) ton enhance
image quality and resolution.

* Engineered a discriminator network with adaptive down sampling, leveraging convolutional blocks and a classifier
for effective adversarial training, demonstrating improved discrimination capabilities in high-resolution
image generation.
